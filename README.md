# The FactMinersToolKit - TableMiner
 __FmtkTableMiner__ is a tool focused on text- and data-mining table structures in text documents as part of the FactMiners Toolkit (fmtk) Digital Humanities project. 
 
 The overall __FactMiners Toolkit__ is a growing collection of Python-based apps and libraries supporting development of the __MAGAZINEgts Ground Truth Storage__ format. This project is focused on development of a _standards-based_ storage format for an _integrated model_ for __complex document structures__ and __content depiction__ in _print-era commercial magazines_, especially the vast trove of these serial publications in the __Internet Archive__.
